## vteleviziChecker
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## This short python script is meant to serve as an 'integrated' notifier of
## TV shows in Ubuntu with libnotify. It is using the capabilites of web
## application vtelevizi.cz and its short personal RSS channel.
##
##
## Dependencies
## ------------
## For correct usage, you have to have python-notify package installed.
## It is available in standard repositories.
##
## Usage
## -----
##   python vtelevizichecker.py username rsshash
## where username is your vtelevizi.cz username and rsshash is a secret part
## of your RSS url.
##
## There are two configuration variables.
## - RSS_UPDATE_TIME - after how many minutes the feed will be refreshed
## - TELL_ME_N_MINUTES_BEFORE - how many minutes before the start of the show
##                             the notification should be displayed. It is then
##                             shown every minute until the start of the show.
##
## After configuration, the script runs in an infinite loop. Every minute, it
## checks whether some show is starting in n minutes. If yes, a notification
## is shown. It is then shown every minute until the show starts. Every m
## minutes, RSS feed is checked again to include updates. Items are stored
## in local list, every time RSS is refreshed, the list is deleted.
